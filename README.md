 ### Clearing the Confusion: AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning Differences
 
Raise your hand if you‚Äôve been caught in the confusion of differentiating artificial intelligence (AI) vs machine learning (ML) vs deep learning (DL).Bring down your hand, buddy, we can‚Äôt see it! Although the three terminologies are usually used interchangeably, they do not quite refer to the same things.</br>

Andrey Bulezyuk, who is a German-based computer expert and has more than five years of experience in teaching people how artificial intelligence systems work, says that ‚Äúpractitioners in this field can clearly articulate the differences between the three closely-related terms.‚Äù</br>

Therefore, is there a difference between artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning?</br>

Here is an image that attempts to visualize the distinction between them:<br>

As you can see on the above image of three concentric circles, DL is a subset of ML, which is also a subset of AI.Interesting?

So, AI is the all-encompassing concept that initially erupted, then followed by ML that thrived later, and lastly DL that is promising to escalate the advances of AI to another level.For diging deeper to understand which is better for your click on <a href = "https://medium.com/ds3ucsd/explaining-the-terms-ai-ml-dl-ds-b0ac43e99f55">more</a>
